<h3 align="center">A start point for React Native lovers</h3>

Lightning is provides 'Lightning fast' startup for your React Native projects and complete guide for your journey!. We worked hard, experienced a lot, discussed so much and built this.

### What is this repository for? ###

Learning stage can be hard and expensive for people... We experienced a lot of things and wasted a lot of time for that. So with this repository, we just wanted to share our experiences, solutions and impressions about React Native and React Native Libraries which are written by community.

### What I will learn from this repository? ###

Actually, I'm not sure, It depends on you. But we'll try our best about key points, tricky things you know... And...

### What we'll get from this setup? ###
Libraries guys, libraries are god's gift for us! I mean, thanks to people who developed those, too (!) Anyway, enough talk, let's go in.

What / Which? | Why?
---------------- | -------------
[React Native Navigation](https://github.com/wix/react-native-navigation) | Thanks a lot to Wix Team for this brilliant job. We are using React Native because it's `native` right? So we need Native Navigation!
[React Native Dropdown Alert](https://github.com/testshallpass/react-native-dropdownalert) | We always need alerts for errors, infos or warnings. So, why aren't we using this library :P
[React Native + i18n.js](https://github.com/AlexanderZaytsev/react-native-i18n) | Most of us need multi language support, so let's bring it into our box!
[React Native Scalable Text](https://github.com/knowbody/react-native-text) | There is infinite screen resolutions and we are developing our apps to all of them (almost) And we are using Text component all the time but there is an issue... This component is not scaling itself for all resolutions but we have Scalable Text for that!
[MobX](https://mobx.js.org) | We need more than component's own states... This is why we need MobX

### How do I get start!? ###
